# postmortem

Upon the release of ALX's System Engineering & DevOps project 0x19,
at approximately 06:00 West African Time (WAT) here in Nigeria, an outage occurred on an isolated
Ubuntu 14.04 container running an Apache web server. GET requests on the server led to
`500 Internal Server Error`s, when the expected response was an HTML file defining a
simple Holberton WordPress site.

## Debugging Process

Bug debugger Brennan (BDB... based on my initials, thought of it right away!) encountered the issue upon opening the project and being instructed to address it, roughly 19:20 PST. He promptly set out to solve the problem.

1. Checked running processes using `ps aux`. Two `apache2` processes - `root` and `www-data` - were properly running.

2. Looked in the `sites-available` folder of the `/etc/apache2/` directory. Confirmed that the web server was serving content located in `/var/www/html/`.

3. In one terminal, ran `strace` on the PID of the `root` Apache process. In another, curled the server. Expected some useful results but was disappointed. `strace` didnâ€™t provide any useful information.

4. Repeated step 3, this time on the PID of the `www-data` process. Lowered expectations this time but got results! `strace` revealed an `-1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)` error when trying to access the file `/var/www/html/wp-includes/class-wp-locale.phpp`.

5. Inspected files in the `/var/www/html/` directory one by one, using Vim pattern matching to find the erroneous `.phpp` file extension. Located it in the `wp-settings.php` file (Line 137, `require_once( ABSPATH . WPINC . '/class-wp-locale.php' );`).

6. Removed the extra `p` from the line.

7. Ran another `curl` on the server. 200 Success!

8. Created a Puppet manifest to automate fixing the error.

## Summary

In short, it was a typo. The WordPress app encountered a critical error in `wp-settings.php` while trying to load the file `class-wp-locale.phpp`. The correct file name, located in the `wp-content` directory, was `class-wp-locale.php`.

The patch was a simple fix, removing the trailing `p` from the filename.

## Prevention

This issue was due to an application error, not a web server error. To prevent such problems in the future, keep the following in mind:

* Test thoroughly! Testing the application before deployment would have caught this error sooner.

* Set up status monitoring. Enable an uptime-monitoring service like [UptimeRobot](./https://uptimerobot.com/) to provide instant alerts for website outages.
